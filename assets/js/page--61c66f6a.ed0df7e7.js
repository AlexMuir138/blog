I learned a lot of things that I had no comfort level with whatsoever. There was a lot of things that I just did not grasp. Day 2 was very difficult for me because I had no idea how to write proper CSS and the next day we are using bootstrap and it is made so much easier. I think the other thing I am struggling with is memorizing the shorthand for everything. Also making things behave on the page especially with the columns, rows, and the x/y variables makes for a lot of trial and error. I am not sure if I am making clean code or not, but hopefully this will just become easier with repetition. I enjoyed my hangups when I overcame them. This is a very rewarding thing to do.")]),this._v(" "),t("p",[this._v("https://alexmuir138.github.io/checkpoint-1/")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
